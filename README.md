The Client was Liam the Owner of DriverPass, The type of System they wanted me to design was to create a system that gives students access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to improve their preparedness for in-person driving tests. What I did particularly well was finding the keep points that the owner wanted to have in their system as well as designing the model. If I wanted to revise one part working on these documents would be my object models, how I would improve it is by having more detail in how each process works. Why is it so important to consider the userâ€™s needs when designing? How I interpreted the user's needs in implementing it into the design is understanding what they need to have for each user what they can have access to and how to make it simple for the user to understand what they need. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it is how it can help make the user's needs for what they need to have in the system. How I approach designing software is finding what the owner of the system needs. What strategies I would be using in the future to analyze and design a system is to find key points that the owner wants in their system and understand what each user's needs are and what access they need.
